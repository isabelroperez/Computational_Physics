Numerical Solutions for Basic Physical Problems using Fortran 95. This repository contains source code implementations that numerically solve basic physical problems using Fortran 95 programming language. These projects employ numerical programming techniques to address various physics problems. These projects also utilize symbolic computation tools such as MathematicaTM to solve physics problems.

# Overview
These projects aim to provide numerical solutions to fundamental physical problems using computational methods. They involve the implementation of algorithms in Fortran 95 to solve differential equations, perform simulations, and analyze physical phenomena.

## Project 1: Eigenvalue Problem
In this project, we explore methods to obtain the eigenvalues of a matrix and perform matrix diagonalization. We applied these techniques to solve the Schr√∂dinger equation with a Coulombian field, expressing the wave function as a radial distribution. The system is transformed into a linear system of equations using the LAPACK library.

## Project 2: Simulation Methods in Physics
This project focuses on simulation methods in physics, specifically the generation of random numbers and random distribution functions. We utilized Monte Carlo methods and Molecular dynamics for implementing source code to simulate a physical problem involving hard spheres in a gravitational field.

## Project 3: Partial Differential Equations
In this project, we tackled numerical solutions of the diffusion equation for a geothermal heating system. Thermal oscillations on the surface propagate towards the interior. The main objective of the study is to determine the optimal depth at which the external circuit of the installation should be placed.

## Project 4: Data Modeling and Fourier Techniques
This project involves data modeling and Fourier transform techniques, including DFT and FFT algorithms. We utilized spectral analysis to analyze deterministic signals and calculate the spectrum of a time series.
